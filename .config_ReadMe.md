I use a git repo on GitHub to store the configuration files so that I can setup the basic environment on any platform quickly. Now support
 - Mac
 - Cygwin

Git repo is at: [config_dir](https://github.com/Runskey/config_dir.git).

In an empty dir I can simply download the config files by:

    git clone https://github.com/Runskey/config_dir.git

But usually I need do this under the `HOME` directory which is, at most time, not empty. For example on my Macbook I need download the config file to `/Users/Lin/`, and this is obviously not empty.

So an alternative is by:

    cd ~    
    git init
    git remote add -t \* -f origin https://github.com/Runskey/config_dir.git
    git checkout master

All folders and files under `~` but not need be stored shall be added to file *.gitignore*.

And I add two submodules to store the config from 3rd-party git repo.

    cd .
    git submodule add https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d.git .
    git submodule add https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git .vim/Vundle.vim
